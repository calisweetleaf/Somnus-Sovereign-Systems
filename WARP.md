This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Somnus Sovereign Systems** is a revolutionary AI Operating System that provides complete digital sovereignty through persistent virtual machines and unlimited execution capabilities. This is a Python-based FastAPI application that implements a dual-layer execution model separating AI intelligence (persistent VMs) from computation (disposable containers).

## Key Development Commands

### Setup and Installation

```bash
# Initial setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build base VM image (for production)
docker build -f configs/dockerfile_base.txt -t somnus-base:latest .
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the main application server
python main.py --config configs/base_config.yaml --port 8000

# Development mode with debug logging
python main.py --debug --port 8000

# Alternative backend server (simplified version)
python backend/app_server.py
```

### Testing and Development

```bash
# No formal test suite is present - the system appears to be in active development
# Manual testing is done by running the server and testing endpoints

# Check system configuration
python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('configs/base_config.yaml')))"

# Validate memory configuration
python -c "from core.memory_core import MemoryConfiguration; print('Config valid')"
```

## Important Implementation Notes

### Memory System Integration
- All user interactions automatically stored with importance assessment
- Semantic search enables intelligent context reconstruction across sessions
- Cross-session continuity maintains conversation context during VM swapping

### "App Swapping" Architecture
- System enables instant transitions between different AI modes (chat, research, coding)
- VM states are cached with high priority for near-zero latency switching
- Model states are preserved to avoid expensive reloading
- Background persistence ensures no data loss during transitions

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Direct AI-to-AI communication protocols for sophisticated collaboration
- Task delegation based on agent capabilities and content analysis
- Real-time synthesis with contradiction detection and resolution
- Structured debate mechanisms for consensus building

### Unlimited Execution Philosophy
- No artificial timeouts or capability restrictions
- Complete system access within secure architectural boundaries
- GPU acceleration for ML training and media processing
- Persistent environments that accumulate capabilities over time

## Security Considerations

- **Local-first architecture** ensures data never leaves user's machine
- **Encrypted memory storage** with user-scoped key derivation
- **VM isolation** provides security through architectural separation
- **Audit logging** of all system interactions and capability usage
- **Granular permission controls** for network access and resource allocation

This system represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI-as-a-Service toward true digital sovereignty, providing unlimited capabilities while maintaining complete user control and privacy.
