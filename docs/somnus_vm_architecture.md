*   **API Communication**: It uses a dedicated client to communicate securely with the host Morpheus application's high-level API. This structured API interface replaces direct SSH access, enhancing security and reliability.

#### Workflow Example: AI Executing a Task

The orchestrator streamlines complex workflows for the AI:
1.  **AI Creates Artifact**: The AI initiates the creation of an artifact, providing a title, content (e.g., Python script), and artifact type.
2.  **Host Provisions Container**: The orchestrator requests the host to create a dedicated, isolated container for this artifact.
3.  **AI Executes Code**: The AI then instructs the orchestrator to execute a specific command within the artifact's container.
4.  **Results Returned**: The execution results (output, errors, exit code) are returned to the AI.
5.  **Memory Storage**: The AI can then decide to store these results or any extracted facts in its persistent memory for future reference.

This high-level abstraction allows the AI to focus on problem-solving rather than the intricacies of infrastructure management.

### 4. Advanced AI Shell (`advanced_ai_shell.py`)

The Advanced AI Shell provides a unified and intelligent command execution interface for AI agents, supporting multiple execution contexts. It acts as the AI's primary command-line interface, capable of routing commands to the most efficient and appropriate environment.

#### Execution Contexts

The shell intelligently routes commands to optimize performance and resource utilization:
*   **VM Native**: Commands are executed directly within the AI's persistent VM. This is suitable for lightweight tasks, system configurations, or operations that require direct access to the VM's persistent state.
*   **Container Overlay**: For heavy computational tasks, such as machine learning training, video processing, or complex simulations, commands are routed to specialized, disposable containers. These containers provide isolated, high-performance environments with access to dedicated resources like GPUs.
*   **Multi-Agent**: When a task requires collaborative intelligence, the shell coordinates execution across multiple AI VMs. It initiates collaboration sessions, delegates sub-tasks to other AI agents, and collects and synthesizes their responses to achieve a unified outcome.
*   **Hybrid**: This context allows the AI VM to orchestrate operations within a container. The VM handles the setup and monitoring, while the container performs the intensive computation. This combines the persistence and control of the VM with the isolated power and specialized tools of containers.

#### Command Classification and Intelligent Routing

The shell classifies incoming commands based on keywords and context (e.g., "docker," "artifact" for container operations; "collaborate," "delegate" for multi-agent tasks; "research," "analyze" for research operations; "code," "build" for development). This classification enables the shell to automatically determine the optimal execution context, minimizing manual configuration and maximizing efficiency.

#### Container Orchestration

The shell's container orchestration capabilities include:
*   **Creation and Execution**: Dynamically creating specialized containers based on task requirements (e.g., specific images, CPU/memory limits, GPU access).
*   **Isolated Artifact Execution**: Ensuring that each artifact runs in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts and maintaining security.
*   **Automatic Cleanup**: Containers are typically ephemeral and are automatically cleaned up after execution, preventing resource accumulation.
*   **Resource Management**: Managing GPU-accelerated execution environments and other resources within containers.

#### Multi-Agent Collaboration

The shell facilitates seamless multi-agent collaboration:
*   **Initiation**: An AI can initiate a collaboration session by defining a task and specifying collaborating AI agents.

3.  **DevSession Creation**: A central DevSession record is created, serving as the source of truth for the AI's environment. This session is linked directly to the provisioned VM.
4.  **Capability Pack Installation**: The orchestrator installs predefined "capability packs" (e.g., "base tools," "web development," "AI research") into the newly created VM. Each installation step is accompanied by a snapshot, allowing for safe rollbacks if any issues arise during the process. This creates a versioned history of the AI's learning.
5.  **Configuration Persistence and Monitoring Setup**: The orchestrator ensures that the VM's configuration is persistently saved and initiates monitoring of the VM's performance and health.

This comprehensive workflow ensures that each AI agent is provisioned with a fully configured, persistent, and secure environment tailored to its needs.

## Memory System Integration: Detailed Breakdown

The Somnus VM architecture is deeply integrated with a revolutionary memory system that enables persistent AI intelligence, seamless VM hot-swapping, and ultra-low compute requirements. This integration is key to the system's ability to provide continuous, evolving AI capabilities.

### Memory Core (`core/memory_core.py`)

The Memory Core provides enterprise-grade persistent memory with semantic indexing, encryption, and cross-session continuity. It is the long-term storage for all of the AI's experiences and knowledge.

#### Memory Architecture

*   **Semantic Vector Storage**: Utilizes ChromaDB as a vector database to store semantic embeddings of memories. These embeddings are generated by advanced sentence-transformer models, enabling highly relevant retrieval through semantic search rather than just keyword matching.
*   **Multi-Modal Support**: The memory system can store and retrieve various types of data, including text, code, files, images, and conversations, providing a holistic view of the AI's interactions.
*   **User-Scoped Encryption**: All stored memories are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption, with user-specific keys derived using PBKDF2. This ensures granular privacy controls and data isolation for each user.
*   **Importance-Based Retention**: Memories are assigned importance levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Temporary), which dictate their retention policies. Critical memories (e.g., user identity, core preferences) are never forgotten, while temporary memories expire quickly. This intelligent lifecycle management prevents memory bloat and ensures the most relevant information is retained.
*   **Cross-Session Continuity**: The memory core enables the reconstruction of context across different sessions, allowing the AI to maintain a continuous understanding of ongoing projects and user preferences, even after VM shutdowns or reboots.

#### Memory Types

Memories are classified to optimize retrieval and retention strategies:
*   **Core Fact**: Persistent user facts, such as name, preferences, or expertise level.
*   **Conversation**: Records of chat exchanges and conversational context.
*   **Document**: Uploaded files, their content, and analysis results.
*   **Code Snippet**: Generated or executed code blocks.
*   **Tool Result**: Outputs and outcomes from plugin or tool executions.
*   **Custom Instruction**: User-defined behaviors or specific directives.
*   **System Event**: Technical events, errors, or diagnostic information.

        R --> S{Identify Expired/Low-Relevance Memories}
        S --> T{Delete from ChromaDB and SQLite}
    end
```

### Memory Integration (`backend/memory_integration.py`)

The Memory Integration system seamlessly bridges the persistent memory core with active sessions, enabling intelligent context reconstruction and "app swapping." It ensures that the AI's long-term knowledge is actively utilized during real-time interactions.

#### Session Memory Context

Each active session maintains a dedicated memory context, managed by the `SessionMemoryContext` class. This context is crucial for maintaining conversation continuity and providing personalized assistance.

*   **Automatic Memory Storage**: Conversation turns (user messages and AI responses) are automatically stored in the persistent memory. This includes not only the raw text but also metadata such as tools used during the turn, which contributes to a richer memory graph.
*   **Context Window Enhancement**: Relevant memories are dynamically retrieved from the memory core and injected into the AI's current context window. This provides the AI with personalized and continuous assistance, referencing past interactions without explicitly stating it's accessing stored memories.
*   **Cross-Session State Management**: This is a critical feature for seamless VM transitions. When an AI switches between different "apps" or VMs (e.g., from a general chat VM to a specialized research VM), the memory integration ensures that the conversational and operational context is preserved and can be seamlessly restored in the new environment.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Memory Access**: Access to memories is strictly controlled and scoped to the user, ensuring that sensitive data remains private and is only used for enhancing the user's experience.

#### Memory-Enhanced Session Management

The `EnhancedSessionManager` extends standard session management to include automatic memory handling, providing a more intelligent and persistent interaction model.

*   **Session Creation with Memory**: When a new session is created, the system automatically initializes a `SessionMemoryContext`. This involves loading relevant memories for the user from the `MemoryManager` and generating an enhanced system prompt that incorporates these memories, tailoring the AI's initial behavior.
*   **Automatic Fact Extraction**: The system employs heuristics (with potential for future NLP enhancements) to automatically extract and store core user facts (e.g., name, preferences, work details) from messages. These extracted facts are given high importance for long-term retention, building a robust user profile over time.
*   **Context Enhancement with Query**: Beyond initial context loading, the system can dynamically enhance the current session's context by retrieving additional relevant memories based on the user's current query. This ensures the AI always has the most pertinent information at its disposal, even as the conversation evolves.

    R --> S[Session Destroyed (Memories Persist)]
```

### System Cache (`backend/system_cache.py`)

The System Cache provides a high-performance runtime caching layer, complementing the persistent memory system. It is crucial for enabling "app swapping" and achieving ultra-low compute requirements by keeping frequently accessed data readily available.

#### Cache Architecture

*   **Multi-Namespace Caching**: The cache is organized into distinct namespaces (Global, Session, User, VM, Artifact, Model, Research, System). This allows for logical separation and efficient management of cached data, preventing conflicts and optimizing retrieval for specific data types.
*   **Intelligent Priority Scoring and LRU Eviction**: Cache entries are assigned priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Temporary) and are evicted based on a sophisticated Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm combined with dynamic priority scores. Critical entries are never evicted, ensuring essential data remains available. This intelligent eviction strategy optimizes cache hit rates and memory utilization.
*   **Background Persistence**: The cache can persist its contents to disk in the background, ensuring data is not lost during system shutdowns and allowing for faster warm-up times upon restart. This provides a balance between volatile high-speed memory and durable storage.
*   **Dependency Tracking**: The cache can track dependencies, enabling intelligent invalidation of cached data when underlying sources change. This ensures data consistency and freshness.
*   **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics are collected, including hit/miss ratios, memory usage, and access times, to continuously monitor and optimize cache performance. These metrics provide valuable insights into system efficiency.

#### Cache Namespaces

Each namespace serves a specific purpose, allowing for granular control and optimization:
*   **GLOBAL**: System-wide data that is universally accessible and frequently used.
*   **SESSION**: User session state, crucial for maintaining conversational flow and temporary session-specific data.
*   **USER**: Personal preferences and user-specific configurations that persist across sessions.
*   **VM**: Virtual machine states, enabling rapid VM hot-swapping and quick restoration of VM environments.
*   **ARTIFACT**: Results and intermediate states of artifact executions, accelerating development and testing cycles.
*   **MODEL**: AI model states, allowing for quick model loading and swapping, reducing latency during model transitions.
*   **RESEARCH**: Investigation data from research activities, enabling fast access to previously gathered information.
*   **SYSTEM**: Internal system data and configurations, ensuring smooth operation of core components.

#### "App Swapping": The Core of the OS Experience

The cache system is central to the "app swapping" capability, which allows for near-instantaneous transitions between different AI functionalities or "apps." This intelligent caching of operational modes is what transforms Somnus from a mere chat interface into a dynamic, responsive operating system.

**Workflow of Seamless App Swapping**:
1.  **User in Active Mode**: The AI is currently operating in a specific mode (e.g., a chat VM, a code development environment, or a research session), with its relevant models loaded and context actively managed by the cache.
2.  **User Initiates Mode Change**: When the user requests a switch to a different AI functionality (e.g., from chat to deep research, or from coding to media creation), the system immediately recognizes the intent.
3.  **Current State Cached**: The current operational mode's state (including VM state, active models, and session context) is rapidly cached with high priority. This ensures that the previous context can be quickly and accurately restored if needed.
4.  **New Mode Activates Instantly**: The target operational mode (e.g., a specialized research VM, a GPU-accelerated media creation environment) is then activated. If its state or relevant research context is already present in the high-performance cache, it loads almost instantaneously, minimizing any perceived delay.
5.  **Fluid Transitions**: After the initial load of a new "app," subsequent transitions between frequently used functionalities become extremely fast (often within ~50ms). This is because their states are persistently preserved and can be loaded directly from the high-performance cache, eliminating the need to reload entire environments from scratch.

This sophisticated mechanism dramatically reduces computational overhead, eliminates frustrating loading times, and provides a fluid, intuitive user experience. It makes the AI feel continuously responsive and adaptive, akin to switching between applications on a modern, high-performance operating system.

### Memory Configuration (`configs/memory_config.yaml`)

The `memory_config.yaml` file provides a comprehensive and granular control over the behavior of the entire memory system. It allows administrators to fine-tune storage, embedding, retention, privacy, and performance settings to meet specific operational and security requirements.

#### Key Configuration Sections

*   **Storage**: Defines parameters for the vector database (ChromaDB path, metadata database path, backup paths), storage limits per user (max memories, max storage size, max document size), and SQLite database optimization pragmas for performance.
*   **Embeddings**: Configures the primary embedding model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) used for semantic search, specifies model cache directories, and allows for specialized models (e.g., `code_embeddings`, `multilingual`). It also includes parameters for batch size, sequence length, and device preference for embedding generation.
*   **Retention Policies**: Crucially defines how long different types of memories are retained based on their importance level. This includes `critical_memories` (never expire), `high_importance` (e.g., 365 days), `medium_importance` (e.g., 90 days), `low_importance` (e.g., 30 days), and `temporary_memories` (e.g., 1 day). Advanced strategies like adaptive retention and importance decay can also be enabled.
*   **Privacy**: Specifies encryption settings (enabled/disabled, algorithm like Fernet, key derivation parameters), user data isolation (strict user isolation, cross-user sharing), and options for anonymization, data export formats, and secure deletion.
*   **Retrieval**: Configures semantic search parameters such as similarity thresholds, maximum results per query, and diversification. It also enables advanced features like temporal weighting (boosting recent memories), importance weighting, and hybrid search (combining semantic and keyword search).
*   **Classification**: Defines settings for automatic memory classification and tagging, including confidence thresholds and patterns for detecting core facts, preferences, technical content, and creative content.
*   **Performance**: Includes caching strategies for memory and embeddings, background processing settings (async operations, batch sizes), memory usage optimization (lazy loading, memory mapping), and monitoring/alerting thresholds for performance issues.
*   **Session Integration**: Details how the memory system integrates with session management, including automatic conversation storage, context injection strategies, cross-session continuity settings, and memory triggers for fact extraction and preference learning.

This comprehensive configuration ensures that the memory system is highly customizable, secure, and performs optimally within the Somnus ecosystem.

## Hot Swapping and Dynamic Reconfiguration

The integrated memory and cache system is fundamental to enabling intelligent VM hot-swapping and dynamic reconfiguration between different AI subsystems. This capability allows the Somnus system to adapt its computational environment on the fly, optimizing for the AI's current task without perceived delays.

### Context-Aware Resource Allocation

The memory system continuously tracks user patterns and AI activities. Based on this context, the VM Supervisor dynamically applies appropriate resource profiles to the active VM. For example:
*   If the memory system detects a "research-heavy" user pattern, the VM Supervisor can automatically apply a "research" resource profile, allocating more memory and CPU for browsing and data analysis.
*   If recent activity indicates "GPU-intensive" tasks, the "media_creation" profile (with GPU enablement) can be activated, ensuring the AI has the necessary computational power.

### Seamless Subsystem Migration

The architecture facilitates instant transitions between various operational modes:
*   **Research Mode**: Activates the AI Browser Research System, providing tools and resources optimized for web investigation.
*   **Development Mode**: Loads a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and development tool suite, tailored for coding and software engineering tasks.
*   **Collaboration Mode**: Enables multi-agent communication protocols and shared workspaces for collaborative problem-solving.
*   **Analysis Mode**: Activates data processing and visualization tools for in-depth data analysis.

### State Preservation During Transitions

A critical aspect of hot-swapping is the preservation of state:
*   Before a subsystem change, the VM Supervisor can create a snapshot of the current VM state. This snapshot captures the entire VM, including its memory and disk, ensuring complete state preservation.
*   The memory context is also updated to reflect these transitions, storing information about the previous mode and the reason for the switch.
*   This allows for seamless restoration or rollback to a previous state if needed, and ensures that the AI's work is never lost during these dynamic reconfigurations.

This intelligent orchestration, driven by the memory and cache systems, provides a fluid and highly efficient AI computing experience.

## Security and Isolation

Security is a core tenet of the Somnus VM architecture, implemented through robust isolation mechanisms rather than artificial limitations. The system prioritizes user control and data privacy by keeping all operations local.

### Network Security

*   **Localhost-Only Communication**: All critical communication between the AI VM and the host system, as well as between different components within the VM, is strictly confined to the localhost interface (127.0.0.1). This design prevents external exposure and unauthorized network access.
*   **Isolated Virtual Networks**: Each VM operates on its own isolated virtual network, preventing direct communication or interference between different AI computers unless explicitly configured for collaboration.
*   **No External Dependencies**: The system is designed to function without reliance on external cloud services or APIs, making complete air-gapped operation possible and enhancing data sovereignty.
*   **Secure SSH**: Access to the VM is secured using key-based authentication for SSH, eliminating password vulnerabilities and ensuring only authorized connections.

### Container Security

*   **Process Isolation**: Each artifact or computational task runs within its own dedicated Docker container. This provides strong process isolation, preventing malicious code or errors in one task from affecting other parts of the system or other VMs.
*   **Resource Limits**: Containers can be configured with CPU and memory constraints, preventing any single task from monopolizing host resources and ensuring system stability.
*   **Network Restrictions**: Optional network access controls can be applied to individual containers, limiting their ability to access external networks or specific internal services.
*   **Temporary Execution**: Containers are typically ephemeral; they are created for a specific task and destroyed immediately after execution. This minimizes the attack surface and prevents persistent malware or data leakage.

### Data Security

*   **Encrypted Memory**: All data stored in the persistent memory core is encrypted using user-scoped encryption keys. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and protected.
*   **Local Storage**: All data, including VM disk images, snapshots, and memory contents, is stored locally on the user's machine. There is no cloud synchronization or reliance on external storage providers, giving the user complete control over their data.
*   **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging tracks all execution and access events within the system, providing a detailed record for security analysis and compliance.
*   **Secure Communication**: Inter-component communication within the system utilizes secure protocols like TLS where appropriate, protecting data in transit.

This multi-layered security approach ensures that the Somnus AI environment is not only powerful but also inherently secure and privacy-preserving.
