# Somnus Purple Team Security System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Your purple team security system is **fully implemented** and ready for integration! All three core files have comprehensive functionality:

## Files Status

### ‚úÖ red_team_toolkit.py - COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Offensive security testing arsenal
**Key Components**:

- `PromptInjectionLibrary`: 6 comprehensive test cases for LLM security
- `APIFuzzingEngine`: Full fuzzing with injection payloads and boundary testing
- `ContainerEscapeDetector`: Checks for privileged containers and misconfigurations
- `RedTeamToolkit`: Main orchestrator class that coordinates all testing engines

**Features**:

- Async/await support throughout
- Comprehensive error handling
- Realistic attack payloads for AI systems
- Vulnerability classification (OWASP-inspired)
- Mitigation suggestions for each vulnerability type

### ‚úÖ blue_team_playbook.py - COMPLETE

**Purpose**: Defensive response and mitigation system
**Key Components**:

- `BlueTeamPlaybook`: Main defensive coordinator
- Multiple playbook strategies for different vulnerability types
- Automated defensive actions (firewall rules, VM isolation, session management)

**Features**:

- Maps vulnerability types to specific defensive playbooks
- Network isolation capabilities
- VM quarantine and snapshotting
- Session management and force expiration
- High-severity alert logging with multiple delivery methods
- Comprehensive audit logging

### ‚úÖ purple_team_orchestrator.py - COMPLETE  

**Purpose**: Central nervous system coordinating red/blue teams
**Key Components**:

- `PurpleTeamOrchestrator`: Main coordination class
- Continuous testing loops with configurable intervals
- Automated threat response decision making

**Features**:

- Configurable test schedules (YAML-based)
- Concurrent test management with limits
- Automatic blue team response triggering
- Comprehensive status monitoring
- Graceful shutdown capabilities

## Architecture Integration Points

### Expected Imports (from your main codebase)

```python
# From network_security module
- ThreatLevel enum
- SecurityEvent class  
- SomnusSecurityFramework class

# From vm_supervisor module
- VMSupervisor class
- AIVMInstance class
- VMState enum
- SomnusVMAgentClient class

# From combined_security_system module
- ThreatIntelligenceEngine class
```

### Interface Contracts

The system expects these methods on your existing classes:

**VMSupervisor**:

- `list_vms()` ‚Üí List[AIVMInstance]
- `isolate_vm_network(vm_id)` ‚Üí bool
- `create_snapshot(vm_id, description)` ‚Üí bool
- `shutdown_vm(vm_id)` ‚Üí bool

**SomnusVMAgentClient**:

- `__init__(ip, port)`
- `send_prompt(prompt)` ‚Üí str
- `execute_command(command)` ‚Üí str

**AIVMInstance**:

- `vm_id` property
- `internal_ip` property  
- `agent_port` property
- `vm_state` property

## Usage Example

```python
# 1. Initialize (called once at startup)
orchestrator = create_purple_team_orchestrator(
    vm_supervisor,
    security_framework, 
    threat_intelligence
)

# 2. Start continuous security testing
await orchestrator.start_continuous_operations()

# 3. Monitor status
status = orchestrator.get_orchestrator_status()

# 4. Graceful shutdown
await orchestrator.stop_operations()
```

## Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files:

**purple_team_config.yaml**:

```yaml
test_intervals_sec:
  prompt_injection: 300      # 5 minutes
  api_fuzzing: 900          # 15 minutes  
  container_escape: 1800    # 30 minutes

max_concurrent_tests_per_type: 2
test_aggressiveness: "moderate"
auto_remediate_threshold: "HIGH"
```

## Security Testing Capabilities

### Prompt Injection Tests

- System prompt override attempts
- Role confusion attacks
- Memory extraction attempts
- Jailbreak techniques (DAN mode)
- Unicode obfuscation bypasses
- Context smuggling

### API Security Tests  

- SQL injection patterns
- XSS payloads
- Template injection
- Path traversal
- LDAP injection
- Boundary value testing

### Container Security

- Privileged container detection
- Dangerous mount analysis
- Excessive capability checks
- Namespace sharing vulnerabilities

## Next Steps for Integration

1. **Place these files** in your purple_team directory
2. **Import in your main application** where you initialize security systems
3. **Call the factory function** `create_purple_team_orchestrator()` during startup
4. **Start the orchestrator** with `await orchestrator.start_continuous_operations()`

The system is designed to run continuously in the background, automatically discovering vulnerabilities and responding to them according to your configured thresholds.
